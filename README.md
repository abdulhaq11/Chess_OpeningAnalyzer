# Chess_OpeningAnalyzer
When given an opening position, the program determines whether the given chess position is practically possible or not. 
And if it is a valid opening position then the program is going to display the name of the opening, winning chances and the variations of the opening.
This was done using the lichess database of two million OTB games of 2200+ FIDE rated players from 1952 to 2019.
Since there are many openings in chess, the most important openings and its variations have been displayed in this project.
